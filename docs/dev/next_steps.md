# Next steps

1. Complete npm publish on npmjs (login, registry, publish, verify install).
2. Add at least one automated test for argument parsing and expectation scoring.
3. Add a small repeatable report-share helper (JSON -> static HTML export command/script).
4. Evaluate optional LLM-judge scoring mode (`expectJudgePrompt`) after parser/scoring tests exist.
