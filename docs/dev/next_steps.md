# Next steps

1. Create a user-facing `fix:`/`feat:` commit and run release-please flow for trusted publish verification.
2. Add at least one automated test for argument parsing and expectation scoring.
3. Verify the JSON -> HTML helper on fresh run reports and document any UX gaps.
4. Evaluate optional LLM-judge scoring mode (`expectJudgePrompt`) after parser/scoring tests exist.
