# Extension SOP

## 1) Plan

- Define scope and acceptance criteria.
- Run `npm run docs:list` and read docs matching your task domain.
- Capture work in `docs/dev/plans/`.
- Confirm risks and dependencies.

## 2) Implement

- Build in small commits.
- Keep command/tool behavior explicit.
- Update docs as behavior changes.

## 3) Verify

- Run `npm run check`.
- Execute relevant extension tests.
- Validate prompt templates if changed.

## 4) Release

- Update `CHANGELOG.md`.
- Tag/version according to team policy.
- Sync extension to live pi when needed.

## 5) Maintain

- Monitor regressions and user feedback.
- Re-run validation after dependency/script changes.
- Keep `docs/dev/status.md` and `docs/dev/next_steps.md` current.
