# Organization operating model

## Organization purpose
Enable teams to build and operate AI-assisted software workflows that are reliable, auditable, and easy to improve.

## Organization mission (current)
Provide practical tooling, standards, and documentation that make safe AI engineering the default path.

## Organization vision
A trusted ecosystem where AI coding workflows are reproducible, understandable, and continuously improving.

## Organization strategic objectives
1. Standardize evaluation workflows across active projects.
2. Improve run traceability and reproducibility metadata.
3. Keep onboarding friction low through concise, current documentation.
4. Maintain secure-by-default release and dependency hygiene.
5. Reduce ambiguity between interactive and non-interactive execution modes.

## Core values
- Clarity first
- Evidence over assumption
- Small, verifiable increments
- Safety for high-impact changes
- Respectful collaboration

## Boundary
Organization purpose is cross-project.
Project-specific purpose is defined in [Project foundation model](../project/foundation.md).
