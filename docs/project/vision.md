# Vision

Make `pi-evalset-lab` the lightweight default for comparing prompt/system variants with reproducible, inspectable reports.

The project should feel predictable for maintainers:
- clear command behavior in both interactive and `-p` modes,
- clear report locations and run identity metadata,
- clear docs for troubleshooting common setup confusion.

Project vision is intentionally separate from organization vision in [Organization operating model](../org/operating_model.md).
