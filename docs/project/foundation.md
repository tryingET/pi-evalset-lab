# Project foundation model

## Project purpose
Build and maintain `pi-evalset-lab` as a practical extension package for fixed-task-set evaluations in pi.

## Project mission (current cycle)
Continue from [NEXT_SESSION_PROMPT.md](../../NEXT_SESSION_PROMPT.md): stabilize post-`0.1.0` delivery by verifying trusted publishing on the next release, improving evaluation reliability, and keeping reports reproducible.

## Scope boundary
- Organization purpose lives in [Organization operating model](../org/operating_model.md).
- This project purpose is repository-specific and intentionally narrower.

## Project operating principles
- Keep changes small and reviewable.
- Prefer explicit run metadata over implicit assumptions.
- Document behavior when UX is surprising.
- Validate structure after meaningful changes.
