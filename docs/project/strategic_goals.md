# Strategic goals

1. Reach stable, documented `/evalset` behavior across interactive and non-interactive usage.
2. Improve reproducibility signals (dataset hash, case hash, variant hash, run lineage) in all report paths.
3. Keep extension docs concise and discoverable for new maintainers.
4. Maintain secure, low-friction release and validation workflow.
5. Expand confidence with focused tests for command parsing and report generation.
